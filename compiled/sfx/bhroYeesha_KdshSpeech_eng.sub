00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Yeesha: The bones of Guildmaster Kadish speak louder than words.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,000
Yeesha: His bones are the bones of D'ni.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeesha: He clung to the teachings of good King Naygen, who required good citizens to cling to their treasure.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Yeesha: This Kadish you have seen would not give back, would not return, would not let go.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,400
Yeesha: He had long been one of the wealthiest of the D'ni, owning more than he could possibly make use of.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Yeesha: He built Ages to protect the extra, and when the Fall came, he clung to his possessions over all else.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeesha: And so you see only death in his vault. Extravagant death. It is an image of D'ni.
