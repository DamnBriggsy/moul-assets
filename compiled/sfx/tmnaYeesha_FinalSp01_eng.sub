1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,200
Yeesha: An ending has been written?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Yeesha: You've done all that has been asked. You've traveled the full circle. You have returned to the Cleft through the Fissure.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,200
Yeesha: You swam among the stars and saw the remnants of previous Journeys.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,800
Yeesha: You have returned, and the pillars were returned. And now one more of the Bahro, the Least, has been returned to D'ni.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,200
Yeesha: You don't need to understand what that means, only that the hand of the Maker has set it in motion.

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,800
Yeesha: Now the circle is complete and the Tree has begun to grow again. The path is now open, and so the symbol of the Journey must change.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,200
Yeesha: Now the beginning is tied to the end. Now you can go where you wish.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Yeesha: The restoration of D'ni awaits.

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,600
Yeesha: The deep city breathes. Uru again.

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,200
Yeesha: And I will be concerned with other things. 

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,600
Yeesha: The Least are becoming greater. They will now also affect the restoration, perhaps not the way others had planned.

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,600
Yeesha: You've learned about the pride of D'ni. The great writers of worlds were infected with pride that became a cancer.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeesha: It grew quietly beneath the surface, but it grew until D'ni could live no more.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeesha: But those things have been told. You understand it well, I think.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,400
Yeesha: Let us end this cycle with rewards, before we start the next cycle.

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:47,800
Yeesha: Relto. The high place. Your Age now. It was the first Age I wrote, a gift for my parents, and now much more.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Yeesha: It reminds me of another home, another place. I even placed the library in the place it belongs.

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Yeesha: But Relto will change. It will be your soul, showing what you are.

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,800
Yeesha: Only I could write Relto. It's beyond what the D'ni could accomplish. Keep it.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Yeesha: And I've given you clothing that represents your Journey. Wear this to show others what side you've taken, when sides are taken.

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Yeesha: When you wear it, you will tell all that you side with us. With Yeesha, with the Bahro. It will not always be easy.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Yeesha: And another gift is here. A link to the Cleft, here in Tomahna.

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Yeesha: You haven't been able to return here, but now you can.

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeesha: This Book will take a special place on your shelf. This place is not meant to be shared.

25
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,800
Yeesha: Return here alone when you wish to remember the cycle of things.
