1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Yeesha: Shorah. Peace to you, mover of the Least.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,600

Yeesha: Seven more Journeys have moved you closer.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Yeesha: I was seduced while in D'ni.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,600
Yeesha: My humble darkness lasted only a short time before I began to bask in what I could do, what I could write.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeesha: My gift, my path. The knowledge of my father and the dreams of my mother pierced a hole in the darkness. In the weakness.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Yeesha: I was aware of my power and I was proud.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,400
Yeesha: Whole worlds at my fingertips.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,800
Yeesha: It was the same with the D'ni, the same cycle. Light opens the darkness. It takes, it uses, and it keeps.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,600
Yeesha: The D'ni found power in these books, these books you use to travel. They were a gift from the Maker.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,400
Yeesha: These Ages you travel to were their Ages. Remarkable places giving life, and taking life.

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeesha: This shadow came over them, this shadow of light, for it was in their enlightenment that they considered themselves better; better than the Least.

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Yeesha: And we were sad for them.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,600
Yeesha: Can you feel the D'ni there? You've touched the remnants, the remains of their pride and power.
