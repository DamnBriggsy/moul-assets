Zandi: Hey. Welcome. So, uh, I'm Zandi.

00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,500
Zandi: (chuckles) Don't worry about it. You felt drawn here, just like the others.

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,900
Zandi: I- I'm not really here to give you answers, just to give you help. Get you started.

00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:36,800
Zandi: Listen to it well. Follow her. Find the Journeys. And then... enter the Tree.

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Zandi: Oh, and uh, check with me if you need help.
