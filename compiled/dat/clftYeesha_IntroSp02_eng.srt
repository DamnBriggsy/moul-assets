1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
Yeesha: Shorah. Rekooahn trekleft preniv legloen b'rem.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,200
Yeesha: Oh yes, not in D'ni. They won't understand.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,000
Yeesha: Once again the stream in the Cleft has begun to flow.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,100
Yeesha: It was dry for so long.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,200
Yeesha: The water is flowing in from the desert.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Yeesha: The storm is coming.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,900
Yeesha: Have you heard of the city? The deep city, the ancient Uru?

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,800
Yeesha: Where there was power to write worlds.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:44,500
Yeesha: For thousands of years, the city lived... lived beneath the surface. Keeper of the secret, keeper of the power, keeper of the Ages.

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,600
Yeesha: Always keeping.

11
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeesha: The city grew proud. And then it died.

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,100
Yeesha: The water flows where it wills.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,500
Yeesha: It seeks its own path uncontrolled except that it flows downward, always downward.

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Yeesha: D'ni, the city of Ages, of other worlds, died. But now it breathes again, it awaits.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,700
Yeesha: Some will seek that destination, but you should seek the Journey.

16
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,800
Yeesha: It's as a fine tapestry, complex beyond comprehension, but now torn.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,800
Yeesha: We will show you remnants; pieces of the tapestry. Pieces of the Journey. 

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,300
Yeesha: Find these remnants, these Journeys. Seven. Seven in each Age. Seven here in the desert.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeesha: Consider it a quest. No, a request.

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,900
Yeesha: Worship.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:03,500
Yeesha: The water flows downward, and there it pools and collects, and finally once again... it reaches the roots.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeesha: And the tree begins to grow again.

23
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeesha: I am Yeesha. My parents brought me to this place.

24
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,200
Yeesha: We will bring you.
