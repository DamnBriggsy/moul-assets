1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
Yeesha: The Journeys are complete. Now take the final pillar. Take it, but hear all I've said.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000

Yeesha: It's the whispers and murmurs that reveal the simple truths.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,600
Yeesha: You hold the precious soul of a Bahro in your Age, in your hand.  Such things are not meant to be held.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,400
Yeesha: Do what I do. I have learned things, seen things, written things they never thought possible.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,400
Yeesha: I have seen the real treasures that are protected by the petty fences of their rules.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,800
Yeesha: I have found the precious gold buried deep beneath the weighty mountains of their laws.

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Yeesha: This is my journey too. I am returning what has been given.

8
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeesha: These years I've spent, this path I've traveled, this gift I've been given. This purpose weighs on me, my burden, the legacy of my father, Atrus.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Yeesha: For we are shaping D'ni. We will mold what comes after.

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,400
Yeesha: We cannot keep the power and the pride from ruining this new D'ni, but we can prepare those who will read between the lines.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,800
Yeesha: The Least are returning. The stream in the Cleft is returning. Life is returning. The Fissure is returning.

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,800
Yeesha: The circle will be completed when you give back what you have taken.

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,800
Yeesha: You must return.
